Adds Clover's signature gun from Undertale Yellow.

Scales with progression (based on Calamity damage values - I tried my best to balance it but feedback would be nice).

Currently has some sync issues in multiplayer (SFX, Chat description, Ricochet bullets are invisible to others) but is otherwise functional.
For PvP, since it is not possible to critically hit players, it is best to aim for the in-between zone.

With Daawnlight Spirit Origin (from Calamity) equipped, the center zone will no longer result in a guaranteed critical hit.
